----------------------------------
Automated soil moisture systems are commonly used in precision agriculture using low cost sensors, thus maximizing the spatial extension but restricting the accuray.
The following code is concern about the use of Arduino Uno with several soil moisture sensors (Capacitive sensor SKU:SEN0193).
